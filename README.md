Pacman CXFX is a port from the original CX based [game](https://github.com/galah4d/pacman-3d) based on the CXFX library.
This game is being developed with the following objectives:

  - Demonstrate the features available on [CXFX](https://github.com/SkycoinProject/cxfx)
  - Test and document the game library
  - Increase awareness for the Skycoin Project (developers of CX and CXFX)

## What is CX?
CX is a general purpose, interpreted and compiled programming language, with a very strict type system and a syntax similar to Golang's. CX provides a new programming paradigm based on the concept of affordances, where the user can ask the programming language at runtime what can be done with a CX object (functions, expressions, packages, etc.), and interactively or automatically choose one of the affordances to be applied.

You can find more info on:
  - The github repo of CX - https://github.com/SkycoinProject/cx/
  - The official website of CX - https://www.skycoin.com/cx/
  - The official website of Skycoin - https://www.skycoin.com/

## The CXFX Library
CXFXâ€™s objective is to facilitate the development of games and applications using CX, allowing developers to focus on building their apps instead of having to write everything from scratch!
At first, CXFX will be a library-only environment, allowing you to access CXFX functionalities from a CX program.
The eventual goal is to have something like a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) game editor, like Unity.
